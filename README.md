# Httpeezy: http without the hassle

## What this package does for you

It simply leverages the http, json/encoding, and io packages to streamline the building, parsing, and sending of http requests.
If you have a struct in the shape of your desired response, and you want to treat any other shaped response as an error, this package offers a very quick way to do that.

## Instructions
Step 1: Build a struct in the shape of your desired response

```
type ExampleResponse struct {
    Foo string `json:"foo"`
    Bar string `json:"bar"`
}
```

Step 2: Construct your request

```
req := httpeezy.GetRequest{
    URL: "http://localhost:8080/example",
    Headers: []httpeezy.Header{
        httpeezy.Header{ Key: "Authorization", Value: "Bearer " + auth_token}
    }
}
```

Step 3: Retrieve a response or an error

```
resp, err := httpeezy.SendGetRequest[ExampleResponse](req)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Step 4: Profit

```
foo := resp.Foo
```

In addition to the errors returned from the send functions, the specific step at which the error occurred will also be logged, i.e. request parsing, status check, response parsing, etc.
